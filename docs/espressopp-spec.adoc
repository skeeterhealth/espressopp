[[introduction]]
== Introduction

{espressopp} is a natural query language that abstracts away the native query language
of any data management system. {espressopp} aims to provide API users with a powerful
yet very simple query mechanism, that hides type and schema of the underlying database.
Last but not least, {espressopp} is designed with security in mind to prevent any kind
of cyber-attack like _code-injection_.

The next sections describe <<syntax, syntax>> and <<grammar, grammar>> of {espressopp}
in great detail. This article ends with some helpful <<examples, examples>> that show
{espressopp} in action.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

_Syntax_ is how a statement is worded and structured. It is the study of the
principles and processes by which statements are constructed in {espressopp}.

The first version of {espressopp} supports logical and matching _operators_ as well as
a number of helpful _macros_. A record is selected when the filtering expression evaluates
to `true` &ndash; an expression is a combination of one or more constants, fields, operators,
and macros that {espressopp} interprets and computes to produce a native query.

_Logical operators_ allow a program to make a decision based on multiple conditions.
Each expression is considered a condition that can be evaluated to `true` or `false`.

.Logical Operators
|===
|Operator |Usage |Description

|`or`
|*expr1* `or` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if either expression does

|`and`
|*expr1* `and` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if both expressions do

|`not`
|`not` *expr*
|Evaluates to `true` if the expression does not
|===

_Matching operators_ allow a program to compare two expressions or determine whether an
expression matches a given condition. Matching conditions can be evaluated to `true` or
`false`.

.Matching Operators
|===
|Operator |Usage |Description
|`eq`
|*expr1* `eq` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if two expressions are equal

|`neq`
|*expr1* `neq` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if two expressions are not equal

|`is`
|*expr* `is` `true` [or `false`]
|Evaluates to `true` if the expression equals the right-hand side Boolean

|`gt`
|*expr1* `gt` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if the left-hand side expression is greater than the right-hand side expression

|`gte`
|*expr1* `gte` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if the left-hand side expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand side expression

|`lt`
|*expr1* `lt` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if the left-hand side expression is less than the right-hand side expression

|`lte`
|*expr1* `lte` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if the left-hand side expression is less than or equal to the right-hand side expression

|`between`
|*expr1* `between` *expr2* `and` *expr3*
|Evaluates to `true` if the expression is within the given range

|`startswith`
|*expr1* `startswith` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if the expression starts with the given string

|`endswith`
|*expr1* `endswith` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if the expression ends with the given string

|`contains`
|*expr1* `contains` *expr2*
|Evaluates to `true` if the expression contains the given string
|===

_Macros_ are single instructions that expand automatically into a set of instructions.

.Macros
|===
|Macro |Arguments |Description

|`#today`
|
|Expands to today's date

|`#now`
|
|Expands to current time

|`#duration`
|Duration in ISO-8601 format
|Expands to a duration in milliseconds
|===

Finally, {espressopp} supports basic mathematics that allow complex expressions.

.Mathematics
|===
|Math |Usage |Description

|`plus`
|*expr1* `plus` *expr2*
|Sums an expression to another

|`minus`
|*expr1* `minus` *expr2*
|Subtracts an expression from another

|`mul`
|*expr1* `mul` *expr2*
|Multiplies an expression by another

|`div`
|*expr1* `div` *expr2*
|Divides an expression by another
|===

[[grammar]]
== Grammar

_Grammar_ is the set of structural rules that govern the composition of statements in
{espressopp}, and *Extended Backus-Naur Form 2* (EBNF2) is the formalism (or metalanguage)
used to describe it.

```
identifier          = . // http://golang.org/ref/spec#identifier
int                 = . // http://golang.org/ref/spec#int_lit
float               = . // http://golang.org/ref/spec#float_lit
string              = . // http://golang.org/ref/spec#string_lit
bool                = "true" | "false" .

Query               = Expression { Expression } .

Expression          = "and" | "or"
                    | ParenExpression
                    | Comparison
                    | Equality
                    | Match
                    | Range
                    | Is .
ParenExpression     = [ "not" ] "(" Expression { Espression } ")" .

Term                = identifier | int | float | string | bool | Macro .

Macro               = "#" identifier [ "(" Term { "," Term } ")" ] .

Math                = Term ( "plus" | "minus" | "mul" | "div" ) Term .

TermOrMath          = ( Math | "(" Math ")" | Term ) .

Comparison          = TermOrMath ( "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte" ) TermOrMath.

Equality            = TermOrMath ( "eq" | "neq" ) TermOrMath .

Match               = Term ( "startswith" | "endswith" | "contains" ) Term .

Range               = TermOrMath "between" TermOrMath "and" TermOrMath .

Is                  = identifier "is" [ "not" ] bool
                    | "is" [ "not "] identifier
                    | identifier "is" [ "not" ] "null" .
```

[[examples]]
== Examples

This article ends with some examples that show {espressopp} in action.

Select the persons with surname *Walker* and name starting with *J*:
```
surname eq "Walker" and name startswith "J"
```

Select the persons who are between 20 and 40 years old:
```
age between 20 and 40
```

Select today's orders that are either not processed or bigger than 3000 items:
```
create_time eq #today and (status neq "processed" or size gt 3000)
```

Select the orders with at least 2000 items that have been created in the past 2 hours:
```
size gte 2000 and not(create_time lt #now minus #duration("PT2H"))
```

Select internal orders issued by employee 110110:
```
employee_id eq 110110 and internal is true
```
Or alternatively:
```
employee_id eq 110110 and is internal
```

Select the orders with customer notes:
```
customer_note is not null
```
